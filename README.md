I Started making this Repository almost a year ago for myself so that i can keep up all the stuff for reading at one place . But after such a long time i can realize that this repository can help beginners and intermediate too for finding and reading stuff during their bug hunting. So i am making this repo public so that more people can put into this and make this repo a big hub for learning. 

*If you like to thank me , just share it and follow me on twitter [ShMalav](https://twitter.com/ShMalav)*

**ALSO I REQUEST PEOPLE WHO GONNA SUBMIT BLOGS TO THIS REPO. PLEASE DO IT SECTION WISE ACCORDING TO BUG TYPE FOR MORE CONVINIENCE TO NEW PEOPLE IN LEARNING.**
